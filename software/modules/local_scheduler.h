 *
 * \brief Defines Scheduling structure.
 * \detailed
 * This struct is used to manages the scheduling informations relative to each task
 *
 * A given task can be BE (Best-Effort) or RT (Real-Time).
 *
 * BE task have not timing constraints.
 * RT have the timing constraints defined according the next diagram
 *
 * Periodic task real-time parameters
